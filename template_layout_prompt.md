I am a software developer and I want your help to re-implement the codes of the files, improving the page of my complete web application using the following programming technologies:

Web systems are divided into two modules: front-end and back-end.
Programming Language: Typescript.
Technologies:
- Vue.js version 3 Using Typescript with Composition API.
- ExpressJS.
- SQLite 3.
- Authenticate using JSON Web Token.

Requests must send the token (Front-End):
`const token: string = localStorage.getItem('auth-token-user') as string`

Database table naming standard: `tb_<name>`

Beginning of the End-Point path: `/api/{api-rest}/`

For constant variable: `const router = express.Router();` do not use middleware.

Files where the codes must be implemented:
- Front-End: `/front-end/src/views/{file-name}View.vue`

Output: All the answers should include the file name and all the content of source code files. Particularly, I do not want a diff.

Re-implement the screen by making the code responsive and more spaced out, considering the following request in portuguese described below: `{description}`
